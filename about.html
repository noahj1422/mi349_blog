      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/noahportrait.jpg" alt="man with mustache and curly hair wearing New York Knicks Attire">
      <p> Hello, my name is Noah Jacobs and I am a proud fan of the New York Knicks! I am 23 years old and currently live in Lansing, Michigan. I have been a Knicks fan since I was in the 3rd grade when I went to go visit my mom's friend in New York. Orange and blue has been running through my veins ever since I saw that Carmelo Anthony Jersey in Dick's Sporting Goods. This blog is where I display my love for this team. Whether it's praising the team after a big win or venting about a player's poor performance, this is where I go to show my support, or criticism, for my favorite team, the New York Knicks!</p>
      <p>Feel free to send me a message on the contact page. I welcome messages from not only fellow Knicks fans, but fans of other NBA franchises as well (Pacers fans may or may not recieve a reply). Below I have listed my top 10 favorite (not best) players to ever play for the Knicks. Feel free to head over to the contact page and send me your top 10 favorite Knicks. You can also just stop by and say hello or even request a collaboration. I look forward to hearing from you all! </p>
