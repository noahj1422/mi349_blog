      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/noahportrait.jpg" alt="man with mustache and curly hair wearing New York Knicks Attire">
      <p> Hello, my name is Noah Jacobs and I am a proud fan of the New York Knicks! I am 23 years old and currently live in Lansing, Michigan. I have been a Knicks fan since I was in the 3rd grade when I went to go visit my mom's friend in New York. Orange and blue has been running through my veins ever since I saw that Carmelo Anthony Jersey in Dick's Sporting Goods. This blog is where I display my love for this team. Whether it's praising the team after a big win or venting about a player's poor performance, this is where I go to show my support, or criticism, for my favorite team, the New York Knicks1</p>
      <p>Feel free to send me a message on the contact page. I welcome messages from not only fellow Knicks fans, but fans of other NBA franchises as well (Pacers fans may or may not recieve a reply). Whether it's to request a colloboration or just say hi, I would love to hear from you.</p>
