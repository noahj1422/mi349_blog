          <h3>Knicks Fire Head Coach Tom Thibodeau!</h3>

          <p>The firing of 5 year head coach Tom Thibodeau has sent shockwaves throughout the NBA world! After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals, the New York Knicks have decided to part ways with Tom Thibodeau in hopes to make that jump to a championship caliber team. While many Knicks fans are upset about this firing, I think that this is a tough yet good decision for the team going forward. Thibodeau played a huge role in bringing this franchise out of the dark and seemingly never-ending drought since their last Conference Finals appearance in 2000. I am extremely grateful for everything he has done for this team and the city but I think in order for this team to make the next step to a championship they needed to address their lack of creative coaching and adaptability. </p>

          <p>Tom’s inability to adapt or try new things both defensively and offensively was the source of many of the teams struggles. With a roster as talented as this, it seems ridiculous to put the ball in Jalen Brunson’s hands for 75% of the game. He is a very talented player, but so are OG Anunoby, Karl Anthony-Towns, and Mikal Bridges. The offense often felt like they were saying “lets just give Jalen the ball and figure something out from there”. Not only were his offensive schemes rudimentary but his inability to adjust his strategy on the fly was non-existent. I remember many quarters where the Knicks were getting scored on at will because Karl Anthony-Towns, our worst and slowest defender, was switching onto their point guard after screens. Most coaches would see that it wasn’t working and adapt but Tom is not most coaches. He would continue that same strategy until the buzzer sounded, and the Knicks lost by 15 to a team with a less-talented roster than us. Also, I can count on my fingers the number of times that we played more than 3 guys off the bench in the regular season. In an 82-game season you can’t wear your best players out like that. I get we have a lot of money invested in our starting five, but they become way less effective and fatigued when you continue to play all your starters 40+ minutes two nights in a row. Again, I am grateful for everything Tom has done to get us back on track but now that we have established ourselves as real championship contenders we need a younger more creative basketball mind to lead us to a championship.</p>

        <h3>Knicks Eliminated by the Indiana Pacers</h3>

        <p>The New York Knicks have officially been eliminated from the NBA playoffs. After losing Games 1 and 2 at home, The Knicks found a way to rally back winning two out of the next three games to force Game 6. Unfortunately, their previous efforts would be in vain as their lack of offensive scheme and poor defensive rotations would send them back home to New York in a brutal Game 6 loss.</p>

        <p>Its hard to see your team fall short after coming so close, but this loss is not strictly negative. The Knicks hadn’t been to the Eastern Conference Finals since 2000, before this year. That’s before I was born! While the team didn’t bring home any hardware, it would be disingenuous to ignore how far this team from their many years of being the punching bag for NBA fans around the country. Two consecutive 50-win seasons, the emergence of one of the most prolific scorers and greatest Knicks players of all time in Jalen Brunson, and the securing of potentially the most talented starting five in team history have brought the fire back to the franchise that was thought to be extinguished! The loss may feel like a step backwards to their days getting bounced out of the playoffs by Reggie Miller and his Pacers crew in the 90’s, but brighter times are ahead! Leon Rose has shown us he knows how to construct a successful team and I have all the faith in the world he will bring this city and team a championship.</p>
